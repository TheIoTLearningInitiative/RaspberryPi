# TmpFs

> _tmpfs is a common name for a temporary file storage facility on many Unix-like operating systems. It is intended to appear as a mounted file system, but stored in volatile memory instead of a persistent storage device. A similar construction is a RAM disk, which appears as a virtual disk drive and hosts a disk file system._ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs)
